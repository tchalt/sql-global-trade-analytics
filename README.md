# Global Trade & BI Analytics System

## Project Overview
A specialized SQL portfolio project simulating a global trade database for **Photovoltaic (PV) Modules** and **Apparel Supply Chain**. This project demonstrates the ability to manage relational data alongside semi-structured JSON content.

## Technical Highlights
- JSON Data Processing**: Leveraging `JSON_EXTRACT` to handle heterogeneous product specs (e.g., Solar Panel Efficiency vs. Apparel Material).
- Multi-Table Joins**: 4-table relational mapping connecting Users, Orders, Order Items, and Logistics for full-chain visibility.
- Advanced BI Reporting**: Utilizing **CTEs** and data aggregation to generate monthly revenue trends and regional performance reports.

## Key Queries Included
1. PV Efficiency Analysis**: Filter high-performance solar panels (>21% efficiency) directly from JSON specs.
2. Supply Chain Traceability**: A 4-table join query providing real-time tracking for global shipments.
3. Monthly Growth Tracking**: Clean, modular reporting using CTEs for business growth analysis.
